The mother became jaundiced in the immediate postpartum period and was found to have hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infection. She is unaware of her hepatitis B (HBV) status but knows that her son received the hepatitis B vaccination on the second day of life.

Drugs that inhibit CYP2C9 can increase plasma levels of Essepro. Patients on Essepro who are also treated with drugs that inhibit or induce this enzyme shhould be monitored closely, and dosage of Essepro may need to be adjusted based on blood pressure response. Important Safety Information Patients treated with Essepro should be advised against sudden discontinuation of therapy. When discontinuing therapy, dosage should be gradually tapered over 2 weeks. Essepro is contraindicated i patients with bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, severe hepatic impairment, and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Essepro should be used with caution in patients with peripheral vascular disease, renal impairment or thyrotoxicoses. Caution should be used in diabetics, as beta blockers may mask some manifestations of hypoglycemia. In general, patients with bronchospastic disease should not receive beta blockers.
